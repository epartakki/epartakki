### Hello world, I am â„“n(â„¯). Well, Eleni.

ðŸ‘¾ I am an independent researcher with one of my passions being artificial intelligence alignment. After completing a degree in computer science and political science, I became fascinated with the potential of AI and science to revolutionize society and improve human lives. I focus on value alignment, reward engineering, and cooperative AI, and outside of development focus on human interaction and societal structures through comparative politics. 

If you are interested in connecting, it would be my pleasure. Feel to reach out via [email](mailto:elenipartakki@gmail.com), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenipartakki/) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/epartakki).
